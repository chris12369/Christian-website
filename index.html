  <p>Now a new vehicle called octane and the octane is unlike any other vehicle you’ll find in Fortnite. This rocket-powered car is capable of boosting to supersonic speeds, climbing up walls, and even flying! In the air, Octane can perform acrobatic stunts like double jumping and dodging to get across rugged terrain quickly. With a bit of practice, these moves can easily outmaneuver entire squads — just don’t run out of boost!   </p> 
  <p>Global football fans,

    Let them know! Specifically, let the squad know what you’re all about. The upcoming Let Them Know Set includes ten Outfits based on the beautiful game, all of which you can personalize with multiple patterns and colors. Personalize your Outfit to a look that’s uniquely you — tons of different looks are possible per Outfit!
